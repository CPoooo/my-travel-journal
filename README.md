# Travel Journal App

## Overview

This is a simple Travel Journal app built with React and Vite. The app dynamically renders travel destination cards using reusable components and displays them on the page. Currently, the app uses mock data to showcase how it would look with real travel information.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: The app efficiently uses React's ability to dynamically render data into reusable components, allowing for easy updates and scalability.
- **Responsive Design**: The app includes responsive design techniques in the CSS, ensuring a good user experience on different screen sizes.
- **Efficient Development**: The app was created in under 2 hours, demonstrating proficiency in React and CSS.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to practice and reinforce the ability to create a React app within a short time frame. This challenge was successfully completed, and the process significantly boosted my confidence in:
- Dynamically rendering data in React
- Creating reusable components
- Writing effective CSS for layout and styling

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone NEED LINK HERE
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-travel-journal
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to the local server URL provided by Vite (http://localhost:5173`) to see the app in action.

## Project Structure

- **`src/components`**: Contains the reusable components like `Navbar` and `Card`.
- **`src/data.js`**: Contains the mock travel data that is displayed in the app.
- **`src/App.js`**: The main app component where the data is mapped and passed to the `Card` components.

## Lessons Learned

- **React**: Reinforced knowledge on dynamically rendering data and using props to pass data to components.
- **CSS**: Gained more confidence in styling components, although CSS remains challenging and complex.
  
  (*Note*: "CSS is still harder than React and JS I swear" ðŸ˜…).

## Future Improvements

- Replace mock data with real API data.
- Add more features like search, filtering, or sorting destinations.
- Improve the design and responsiveness further.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent exercise in React and CSS, proving that creating functional apps within a short timeframe is achievable with practice and understanding. The app serves as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
